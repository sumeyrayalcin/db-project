/*
 GROUP BY
 the group by clause divides the rows retrieved from
 the select statement in to
 group basen on the row we provide.
This query groups all the record based on their job_id
 so that we can implement aggregate functions to each group.

 If we want to filter the result AFTER we got the group
 by query result, having clause

 The having statement sets the condition for group rows created
 by the GROUP BY clause after the GROUP by applies.

 where -individual
 group by- group

 WHERE clause sets the condition for individual rows BEFORE
 GROUP BY clause applies.
